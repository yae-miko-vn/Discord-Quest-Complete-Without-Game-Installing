> A quest completer for Discord. Discord Quest Completer. I don't know what to call this, but there it is.

A Windows desktop application for Discord Rich Presence and completing Discord Quest for games without needing to install the full actual games/applications. Perfect for completing Discord Quests and showing off your gaming status without the storage burden.

## 📥 Installation

### Windows

You can download manually pre-built release binaries on the [Releases](https://github.com/markterence/discord-activity/releases) page.

Alternatively, you can follow the [development setup instructions](#-development-setup) to build the app from source.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure you place or extract in a location where you have write or execute permissions.
> 
> The reason for this is that the app will create dummy game file in the same directory.
> By default, the app will not need to be run as administrator, unless if it was installed in a directory that requires elevated permissions. (e.g. `C:\Program Files\`, root of `C:\`, etc.)


> [!NOTE]
> Webview2 is required to run the app. WebView2 comes preinstalled on Windows 11. On versions older than Windows 11 you may need to install it manually.
> If you don't have it installed, you can download it from [here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2).


## Uninstall

To uninstall the app, simply go to the folder where you extracted or placed the app and delete it's folder and thats it.

The content of the folder may look like this:

```text
discord-quest-completer/
├── discord-quest-completer.exe (main app)
├── data/ 
│   ├── src-win.exe (runner dummy template)
├── games/
│    ├── <game-id>/
```

<!-- COMMENT:
  This folder on local app data seems to only exists when using the installer or when Web API like local storage was used? 
  Bring the section back once it's verified it was also existing using the quick portable builds.
-->
<!--
**Other optional files to remove when uninstalling:**

Delete the `me.markterence.discordquestcompleter` folder on `%localappdata%`. 

```bash
# Put this on File Explorer's address bar to navigate on the folder.
%localappdata%/me.markterence.discordquestcompleter
```

The folder `%localappdata%/me.markterence.discordquestcompleter` contains the WebView2 files used by Tauri for the this app. The contents of the folder varies per-user but it may look this this:

```
EBWebView
.cookies
```


> The `%localappdata%` is a system variable on Windows and is equivalent to `C:\Users\<YOUR USER>\AppData\Local\`.

## ✨ Features

- Simulate playing verified Discord games without intalling a full game!
- Complete Discord Quests requiring 15-minute gameplay (not yet tested for Stream the game Quests)
- Only Discord Verified games are supported. The application fetches a list of games that Discord can automatically detect.

## ⚙️ How It Works

This app creates small executable files that mimic the actual game processes that Discord looks for when detecting a verified game to use it for it's Rich Presence activity. 

The executale files are placed in a created folder structure in the `games/` folder relative to the main application's exe.

When launched/played, the tiny executables trigger Discord's Rich Presence/Registed Games detection. (As of release build v2025.10.07 the dummy executable file size is 257kb)

> [!TIP]
> After launching some games over a period of time, those files may accumulate. For a little maintenance, you can manually delete the created folders under the `games/` folder if you need to.

<!--
> _Currently, I am hesitant to add a file‑maintenance operation that deletes or clears the `games/` folder, because doing so may still cause unexpected issues. On Windows, the file system is case‑insensitive, so if you have a file named `Notes.txt` and you issue a command to delete `notes.txt`, Windows will still delete the `Notes.txt` file (the one that begins with a capital “N”)._
-->

## Use Cases

- Complete Discord Quests without downloading massive game files
- Show-off playing the latest games on your status if you want to. (Even if you don't really have it.) (LOL)
- Save disk space while still participating in Discord's Quest.
- I want to complete the Quest but I don't want to install the game's anti-cheat, game is too big, or it won't run on my PC.
- Useful for users with limited internet bandwidth or storage space

<!-- ## 🚀 Planned Features and fixes

- Make the "Stop" button work again if process was terminated outside of app's control.
- Persist games that added on the list so it wont reset.
- Discord Activity Simulator/playground (Customizable rich presence for developers and custom activities)
- Set custom activity status from supported games
- Linux and MacOS support (if possible) -->

## 🖥️ Supported Platforms

- Windows 11 (not tested on Windows 10 but it should work)

### 🐧 Linux and 🍎 MacOS Support?

_TL;DR: Linux and macOS are not supported._

Currently, only Windows is supported. I will try to add Linux support if I can. I don't have a macOS machine to test on, so macOS support is not going to happen.

The reason for not having Linux and macOS support right now is that I want to make sure the dummy game runner has a minimal size — around 100KB or less for each platform.  
For Windows, for example, I used Rust and the `windows` crate to access the Win32 API and create a dummy window. This compiles to a small 136KB executable.  
I also tried a C# .NET app, which is fantastically small — only 7KB — but it may require the end-user to install the .NET 4.7 Runtime.

For Linux, I don’t know where to start yet. I will try to explore more options to keep the runner binary small. It’s also a pain (Wine, Proton, etc. How does Discord detection even work on Linux? LMAO — same for macOS).  
Additionally, if you are trying to run the windows build trough Wine in Linux, some of the dependencies such as Microsoft WebView2 somewhat problematic to install and get running.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- 🦀 Rust
- 🌐 Vue.js
- 🧰 Tauri

## 🧑‍💻 Development Setup

### 🖥️ Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) + [Tauri](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tauri-apps.tauri-vscode) + [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)

### 📋 Requirements

- Tauri - make sure the [pre-requisites](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) are installed such as Rust.
- NodeJS - use any that is latest or node 20+
- pnpm - project uses pnpm as package manager for the frontend.

### 🛠️ Development

Install dependencies for the Vue.js frontend using pnpm

```bash
pnpm install
```

Make sure to build and copy the dummy game binary from `src-win` and is add it on tauri application's "resources" folder.

```bash
pnpm build:runner:win && pnpm copy:runner:win
```

Then run the Tauri dev command to start the development server.

```bash
pnpm tauri dev
```

- Also, get the list of detecatable games from the Discord API: `GET /api/applications/detectable` or `GET /api/:version/applications/detectable` and place the JSON file in `src/assets/gamelist.json`

## Other Thoughts

### The Discord's RPC server and Rich Presence 

There is also an experimental action like Discord RPC functionality along the selected game.
It connects to Discord's RPC Gateway to send Activity updates for the selected game using its App ID, even if the game is not actually running. (This is Rich Presence only so Quests will not detect it)

(This may not work for some time, as Discord updates their RPC and SDK. The syntax I used in the Rust code may not be updated, as it is not one of the main focus of this app.)

Though this is functional as it uses Discord Rich Presence, what happens is it uses the App ID of some App on Discord and connects it to the RPC.  
See: [Discord Developer Docs – Creating an App](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started#step-1-creating-an-app)

For example, the App ID for Overwatch is `356875221078245376`, and we use it with something like [discordjs/rpc](https://github.com/discordjs/RPC).


```js
// Set this to your Client ID.
const clientId = '356875221078245376'; // This is Overwatch's App ID on Discord, not one I created.
DiscordRPC.register(clientId);

const rpc = new DiscordRPC.Client({ transport: 'ipc' });
const startTimestamp = new Date();

// You will see "Verified Overwatch" on Discord Activity with custom details.
rpc.setActivity({
  details: `Bleet bleet`,
  state: 'in bleet bleet party',
  startTimestamp,
});
```

This may not be the intended use of Discord's RPC and may violate their Terms of Service.  
I am not entirely sure if you can use others' App IDs other than the ones you own in the Discord Developer Dashboard for the application you are developing.
Use this feature at your own risk.
